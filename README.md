# Machine Learning Prediction Model (KNN)

This is a repository for a vehicle prediction machine learning model.

Technologies used: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Sckit-learn, Pandas and Jupyter Notebook

Initially gathered vehicle data (horsepower, acceleration time, weight, type of vehicle) and exported it into an Excel file (.csv). Processed and organized the data using NumPy and Pandas, then analyzed it using various graphs using Matplotlib. Further used Sckit-learn to create a K-Nearest-Neighbors Machine Learning prediction model, and tested/adjusted different model parameters to determine values that return best training and testing scores. Given the weight, horsepower and acceleration time of a given vehicle, this model can predict if it is a car or truck/SUV.
